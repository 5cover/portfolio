I had already played many solo games but I was tired of them. I wanted to try the multiplayer experience.</p>\n        <p>That's why I chose to join Dreamfinity, a survival/faction server on the same theme of automation.</p>\n        <p>I started on Spacecross. I traveled the world for a while before settling down in the steppe, between 3 hills.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my base on Spacecross\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/base-spacecross.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>Screenshot of my base on Spacecross.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <h4>My (brief) space conquest</h4>\n        <p>The conquest of the Moon was a short but intense part of my game.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of me in my rocket on my way to the Moon\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/construction-fusee.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>I built a rocket to go to the moon!</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>However, after arriving, I noticed a problem with my oxygen mask and I began to suffocate:</p>\n        <p>Fortunately, the cavalry arrived: another player came to my rescue.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of another player coming to my rescue\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/secours.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>Thanks&nbsp;!</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>Despite the language barrier, we became friends.</p>\n        <p>Finally, I was able to plant my flag (which has <em>absolutely</em> nothing to do with current events)</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my ukrainian flag on the Moon\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/drapeau.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>My flag on the Moon</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>In the end, I'm surprised to have made it this far.

A few months after this rather frustrating experience I joined Technocracy. This sub-server is similar to Spacecross, except that it is not oriented towards space conquest but industrialization on Earth. Which is, in the end, what I wanted. And so a claim system is proposed to protect its constructions from looting.</p>\n        <p>I built my base:</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my base on Technocracy\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/base-technocracy.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>A silo that sinks underground with a glass dome and a spire symbolizing the power and glory of my industrial empire.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>Everything was fine, however after a few months of rest it was dismay. All my resources and constructions disappeared.</p>\n        <p>After asking the question on the Dreamfinity Discord server, I learned that the world had been <strong>reset</strong>.</p>\n        <p>Suffice to say, I won't be returning to this server anytime soon.</p>\n        <p>I guess the lesson here is that solo isn't so bad.</p>\n    </div>\n</article>","title":"Sandbox videogames"}}
