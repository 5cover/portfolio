<h2>Review of Design Choices and Information</h2>
<p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">Overall, the structure of the site is well thought out and comprehensive. Here are a few
    suggestions to improve the design choices and information provided on the site:</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Home page</strong>: Consider adding a professional headshot or avatar to make
            the introduction more personal. Also, you may want to include a brief summary of your skills and expertise.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Project search page</strong>: It would be helpful to include a way to sort
            projects by date, relevance, or other criteria. Additionally, consider adding a way to view more information
            about a project without leaving the search page, such as a modal window or a tooltip.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Experience page</strong>: Consider adding a brief summary of each experience,
            highlighting your role, responsibilities, and achievements.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Interests page</strong>: It would be interesting to include a brief
            explanation of how your interests relate to your programming skills or projects.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Individual project pages</strong>: Consider adding a way to navigate between
            projects, such as previous and next buttons. Also, consider adding a way to share projects on social media
            or via email.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<h2>Guide on Implementing the Site</h2>
<ol>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>HTML</strong>: Use semantic HTML5 elements to structure the content of the
            site. For example, use the <code>&lt;header&gt;</code> element for the navigation bar, the
            <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> element for the main content, and the <code>&lt;footer&gt;</code> element for the
            contact information.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>CSS</strong>: Use a CSS framework such as Bootstrap or Foundation to create a
            responsive layout. Use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes. Use CSS variables for
            theming.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>JavaScript</strong>: Use JavaScript to add interactivity to the site, such as
            hover effects, modal windows, and tooltips. Use a library such as jQuery or React to simplify the code.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Localization</strong>: Use a library such as i18next to handle localization.
            Store the translations in separate JSON files for each language.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Responsivity</strong>: Test the site on different devices and screen sizes to
            ensure it is responsive. Use tools such as Chrome DevTools to simulate different devices.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Accessibility</strong>: Ensure the site is accessible to all users, including
            those with disabilities. Use tools such as the WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool to check for
            accessibility issues.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Performance</strong>: Optimize the site for performance. Use tools such as
            Google PageSpeed Insights to identify performance issues and suggestions for improvement.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p class="mb-2 last:mb-0"><strong>Deployment</strong>: Deploy the site to a hosting provider such as GitHub
            Pages or Netlify. Use a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to automate the
            deployment process.</p>
    </li>
