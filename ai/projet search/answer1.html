<p class="mb-2 last:mb-0">Sure, I can help you with that! Here are some suggested searching features that you can
    include in your project search page with a vertical search toolbar:</p>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Search bar:</strong> This is the most basic and essential feature of any search page. It allows users to
        type in keywords or phrases to search for specific projects.</li>
    <li><strong>Filtering options:</strong> You can include filtering options in your search toolbar to help users
        narrow down their search results. For example, you can add filters for project type, date range, and tags. This
        will make it easier for users to find what they're looking for without having to sift through irrelevant
        results.</li>
    <li><strong>Sorting options:</strong> You can also include sorting options to allow users to sort their search
        results by relevance, date, or other criteria. This can help users find the most relevant or recent projects
        quickly and easily.</li>
    <li><strong>Faceted navigation:</strong> This feature allows users to filter search results based on specific
        criteria, such as tags or categories. It provides a more granular way to filter search results and can help
        users find what they're looking for more quickly.</li>
    <li><strong>Autocomplete:</strong> This feature suggests search terms or phrases as users type in the search bar. It
        can help users find what they're looking for more quickly and can also help them discover new projects that they
        might not have thought to search for.</li>
    <li><strong>Advanced search:</strong> This feature allows users to search for projects using more complex queries,
        such as Boolean operators or nested queries. It can be helpful for users who want to find projects that meet
        very specific criteria.</li>
    <li><strong>Search history:</strong> This feature allows users to see their previous search queries and results. It
        can help users retrace their steps and find projects they've searched for in the past.</li>
    <li><strong>Synonyms and stemming:</strong> This feature allows users to search for synonyms or variations of a
        keyword or phrase. It can help users find what they're looking for even if they don't know the exact
        terminology.</li>
    <li><strong>Spelling suggestions:</strong> This feature suggests corrections for misspelled search terms. It can
        help users find what they're looking for even if they make a typo.</li>
    <li><strong>Search analytics:</strong> This feature provides insights into how users are searching for projects,
        what they're looking for, and what they're finding (or not finding). It can help you optimize your search
        functionality and improve the user experience.</li>
</ol>
