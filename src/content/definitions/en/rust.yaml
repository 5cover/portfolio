  "synopsis": "Rust is a general-purpose programming language emphasizing performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safety, meaning that all references point to valid memory. It does so without a traditional garbage collector; instead, both memory safety errors and data races are prevented by the \"borrow checker\", which tracks the object lifetime of references at compile time.",
