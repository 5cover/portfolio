      With the plethora of free time that confinement gave me in 2020, I built a business empire. I became one of the

      Minecraft is a very complete game, but I've always had an interest in mods. Especially in relation to
      industrialization and automation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because yes, in video games what I like the most is exploiting the environment, building factories, automating
      production. It's better to do this in a video game than in real life.
    </p>
    <p>
      For this you need mods like{' '}

      ... I had already played many solo games but I was tired of them. I wanted to try the multiplayer experience.
    </p>
    <p>That's why I chose to join Dreamfinity, a survival/faction server on the same theme of automation.</p>
    <p>
      I started on Spacecross. I traveled the world for a while before settling down in the steppe, between 3 hills.
    </p>

    <h4>My (brief) space conquest</h4>
    <p>The conquest of the Moon was a short but intense part of my game.</p>
    <figure class="figure">
      <img
        alt="Screenshot of me in my rocket on my way to the Moon"
        src="/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/construction-fusee.png"

        loading="lazy"
      />
      <figcaption>I built a rocket to go to the moon!</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>However, after arriving, I noticed a problem with my oxygen mask and I began to suffocate:</p>
    <p>Fortunately, the cavalry arrived: another player came to my rescue.</p>
    <figure class="figure">

        height="1080"
        loading="lazy"
      />
      <figcaption>Thanks&nbsp;!</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>Despite the language barrier, we became friends.</p>
    <p>Finally, I was able to plant my flag (which has *absolutely* nothing to do with current events)</p>
    <figure class="figure">
      <img
        alt="Screenshot of my ukrainian flag on the Moon"

      />

      In the end, I'm surprised to have made it this far. Even though in the end, my base was looted and I lost
      everything, I had a lot of fun building it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, I didn't understand anything about how the server worked or the messages. It's a Russian server and there
      was no English translation available.
    </p>
    <h4>Technocracy and the Great Reset</h4>
    <p>
      Okay. A few months after this rather frustrating experience I joined Technocracy. This sub-server is similar to
      Spacecross, except that it is not oriented towards space conquest but industrialization on Earth. Which is, in the
      end, what I wanted. And so a claim system is proposed to protect its constructions from looting.
    </p>
    <p>I built my base:</p>
    <figure class="figure">

        empire.
      </figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Everything was fine, however after a few months of rest it was dismay. All my resources and constructions
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>After asking the question on the Dreamfinity Discord server, I learned that the world had been **reset**.</p>
    <p>Suffice to say, I won't be returning to this server anytime soon.</p>
    <p>I guess the lesson here is that solo isn't so bad.</p>
