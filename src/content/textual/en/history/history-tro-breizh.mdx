In August 2024, I participated in the <a class="link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tro.bzh/">Tro Breizh</a>, an organized hike around Brittany, which follows the historical route of the 7 saints. This year, there were about 500 participants. I also helped as a volunteer setting up the lunch tents and serving meals.
