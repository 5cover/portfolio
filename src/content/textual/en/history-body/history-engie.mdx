Joining ENGIE first as an intern, then as an apprentice, was my entry point into large-scale products. I paired with another trainee, rotated between maintenance and small feature work, and learned how release cycles look when dozens of people share the same codebase.

Key takeaways:

- pairing works best with explicit roles and frequent sync points;
- impact is easier to measure when tasks stay close to users and operations;
- writing notes after each sprint made it easier to explain choices to mentors.

That cadence convinced me to pursue an engineering track: I like the mix of concrete delivery, shared standards, and measurable outcomes.
