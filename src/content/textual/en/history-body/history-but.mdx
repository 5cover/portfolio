                        Designing, creating and implementing IT solutions that meet the digital transformation needs of
                        companies is the daily life of the holder of the BUT in IT, regardless of the sector in which
                        their company works.

                    <p>
                        In three years after the baccalaureate, the BUT offers university training that combines theory
                        and practice, with an emphasis on progressive professionalization for rapid integration, while
                        guaranteeing a sufficient scientific level to allow those who wish to continue their studies.

                        The holder of the BUT specializing in IT is competent on technical and methodological levels
                        while being aware of current issues (data security, <em>cloud computing</em>, artificial
                        intelligence), on societal, legal, ethical and environmental issues related to the uses of
                        digital technology.

                        At the end of a one-year common core, the student will be able, depending on their professional
                        project, to choose one of the four paths offered by the IT specialization.

### Why choose the BUT in Computer Science?

- The program matches my interests: software engineering and data;
- The Lannion IUT campus is close to home.

### Global synthesis

The curriculum reads like a climb in abstraction and responsibility:

1. Make things work;
2. Make things work within a clear frame;
3. Make things work at scale.

That mirrors the progression of roles in the industry while keeping a solid technical base.

### Personal view

I particularly enjoyed the first year: immediate immersion into practice with theory in parallel.

It fits how I learn best: _learning by doing_ and concrete deliverables.

The following years add the tools needed to understand real-world constraints and modern systems.

### Next steps

After the BUT, I intend to continue toward an engineering degree.

Schools on my radar: ENSSAT (Lannion), ENSI (Caen), ENSIMAG (Grenoble).

### Professional experience

My [second-year internship at Engie](/portfolio/en/history/history-engie.html) was my first true experience inside a large team, with visible impact.

Beyond technical skills, two lessons stood out:

1. I am more comfortable when stakes are concrete, measurable, and immediate. When a project helps someone directly, I stay aligned. For more theoretical or administrative work, I need extra structure.
2. I paired with another intern. Continuous feedback can be a strength or friction. Communication, clear task boundaries, and playing to each person's strengths keep it productive.

Since that internship, I returned to Engie as an apprentice, contributing to various development missions.

These experiences solidified my plan to become a software engineer.
