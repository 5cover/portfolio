I spent my high school years at Lycée Saint-Joseph-Bossuet in Lannion, where I gradually confirmed that computer science was more than a hobby. After a broad first year, I doubled down on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.education.gouv.fr/reussir-au-lycee/la-specialite-numerique-et-sciences-informatiques-au-bac-325448" data-def-id="nsi" class="link def-tooltip-trigger">NSI</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.lyceeschoelcher972.fr/specialite-llcer-amc/" data-def-id="amc" class="link def-tooltip-trigger">AMC</a>, choosing to drop math so I could focus on building and writing.

I kept a small set of rituals that carried me through the final exams:

- weekly study groups to rehearse oral presentations;
- a personal notes system to connect coursework with small coding experiments;
- volunteering for open days to explain the tracks to younger students.

Those habits made the Bac less of a sprint and more of a steady climb, and they set the pace for how I approach learning today.
