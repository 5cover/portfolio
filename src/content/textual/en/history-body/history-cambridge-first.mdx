Preparing for the Cambridge First Certificate was my first formal dive into professional English. I practiced with mock interviews, listened to tech podcasts to mirror everyday vocabulary, and rewrote my own projects' documentation in English.

The exam day itself felt familiar rather than stressful: speaking sections echoed pair-programming discussions, and the writing tasks were close to the documentation work I already enjoyed. The certificate validated my level, but more importantly it made English my default language for learning and collaborating online.
