The Tro Breizh is a long-distance pilgrimage around Brittany. I joined with friends for a summer stage between two semesters, carrying just enough gear to stay light on the trails.

- Planning the route taught me to work within constraints: limited daylight, finite energy, shared pace.
- Each day ended with a short debrief, a habit I later reused on school projects.

Walking for hours with no screen time cleared space to think about what I wanted from the rest of my studies: projects with tangible stakes, and teams where communication is as valued as delivery.
