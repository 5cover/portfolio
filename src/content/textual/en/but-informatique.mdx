### Why choose the BUT in Computer Science?

- The program matches my interests: software engineering and data;
- The Lannion IUT campus is close to home.

### Global synthesis

The curriculum reads like a climb in abstraction and responsibility:

1. Make things work;
2. Make things work within a clear frame;
3. Make things work at scale.

That mirrors the progression of roles in the industry while keeping a solid technical base.

### Personal view

I particularly enjoyed the first year: immediate immersion into practice with theory in parallel.

It fits how I learn best: *learning by doing* and concrete deliverables.

The following years add the tools needed to understand real-world constraints and modern systems.

### Next steps

After the BUT, I intend to continue toward an engineering degree.

Schools on my radar: ENSSAT (Lannion), ENSI (Caen), ENSIMAG (Grenoble).

### Professional experience

My [second-year internship at Engie](/portfolio/en/history/history-engie.html) was my first true experience inside a large team, with visible impact.

Beyond technical skills, two lessons stood out:

1. I am more comfortable when stakes are concrete, measurable, and immediate. When a project helps someone directly, I stay aligned. For more theoretical or administrative work, I need extra structure.
2. I paired with another intern. Continuous feedback can be a strength or friction. Communication, clear task boundaries, and playing to each person's strengths keep it productive.

Since that internship, I returned to Engie as an apprentice, contributing to various development missions.

These experiences solidified my plan to become a software engineer.
