<p>Computers are extremely powerful and advanced compared to how they were just a few decades ago. Nowadays, even low-tier CPUs performs several billion calculations per second. It's really incredible to think that the device that you're using to read this right now is this powerful.</p>
<p>We've become so dependent of computers over the years without understanding their complex inner workings. We boot up our devices, run software, play games, go on the internet and we've become intolerant to any sort of failure or latency. We often complain of the slowness of computers without ever thinking of all the complexity of making all what they offer actually work.</p>
<p>Is that an issue? Should we instead bear unsatisfying computer experiences, and never complain?</p>
<p>As the creator of WinClean, I don't think so. We should do the exact opposite. We have a right to be furious when things don't work well. Why? Billions of calculations per second. What can't you do with that?</p>
<p>Just ask it, why does it always have to be so painstakingly slow ?</p>
<p>So, whose fault is it? Bad software? Bad hardware? Who cares? Clean it up!</p>
