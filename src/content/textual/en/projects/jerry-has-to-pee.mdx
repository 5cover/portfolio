### 1. Evening at the Smiths' Residence

The Smiths house at night looks like it is trying to pretend it is normal.

Streetlamp glow on the sidewalk. Snow that is not falling but feels like it should be. Through the living room window: frantic motion, too many hands, the kind of argument that has stopped being about anything and become a hobby. Shapes of words, muffled through glass.

Inside, voices pressed against walls that did nothing to them.

"Jerry, you cannot do the thing where you make it about you by making it about nobody!" Beth, sharp and tired.

"It was about me because you were making it about you!" Jerry, escalating into incoherence with the confidence of a man who has never met a consequence he could not trip into. His hands made soft chopping motions in front of his chest like he was slicing the air into reasonable pieces.

Summer: "I swear to God, if you guys start doing like, relationship improv again, I'm gonna go live in a sewer. Like an actual sewer, not the metaphor."

Morty was standing halfway down the stairs with his hand on the banister, not moving. The banister had a glossy spot where everyone's palms had worn it down. He watched the living room the way you watched a kitchen timer you didn't trust.

A door in the hallway bangs. Footsteps. Rick swings into the living room with the expression of a man who has been interrupted while trying to not care about anything.

"Jesus Christ," Rick says. "Do you guys ever get tired of being the same argument in different costumes? Like, at least do a new bit. Do a racism. Do a cult. Get some hobbies."

Beth: "Dad, stay out of it."

"Stay out of it?" Rick laughs once. It is not a happy sound. "Lady, I live here. Your entire life is a series of things I'm in, whether I want to be or not."

Jerry tries to take advantage of momentum. "Rick, you always do this. You come in, you make it worse, then you act like we're the problem."

Rick leans in. His eyes are too bright. "Jerry, you are the problem. You're like if a problem had a smaller, wetter problem inside it."

Jerry flinches, then points a finger at Rick. "See? This! This is what I'm talking about. You don't respect me."

"I don't respect gravity either, Jerry, but I still have to deal with it."

Morty slides down the staircase, quietly. He is leaving without making it a thing. He has learned. He reaches the door and slips out onto the porch.

Outside, cold air, stars. The night is calm in a way that feels like it is mocking the inside of the house.

Rick is already out here.

Morty freezes. Rick is standing at the edge of the porch, hands in his lab coat pockets, staring up like he is trying to remember something he forgot to be ashamed of. He looks almost still. Almost human. The Milky Way is a pale bruise across the sky.

Morty does not say anything. He does not want to interrupt whatever rare neutral state Rick has drifted into. He backs away, slow, and goes around the side of the house before Rick sees him.

Inside, the argument resumes like a machine that was never turned off.

Rick storms back in with a decision already made, which is how he does every decision that is going to hurt someone else.

"Garage. All of you. We're going for a field trip," Rick says, already walking.

Beth follows because she always does, because he is her father and because a part of her still hopes he would turn around and say, "Actually, never mind." Summer follows because she doesn't want to be the only one left in the living room with Jerry. Jerry follows because the argument had shifted locations and he needs to keep up if he wants to keep being included. Morty follows because the word "garage" in Rick's mouth always meant danger dressed as a shortcut.

The garage smelled like gasoline and cardboard. Rick's workbench was a permanent crime scene of science: scorched solder marks, half-disassembled devices, cups with things drying in them that had once been liquids, and a small pile of safety goggles that had never once prevented anything.

In the middle of the floor sat three pod-like chairs that hadn't been there yesterday. They looked like recliners that had been to an alien dentist. Wires ran from them into a terminal with a screen that blinked soft green lines.

Rick slaps it with the flat of his hand. The screen steadies, as if it had been startled.

"Solution," he says. The word had no pride in it. It was a label. "You people want to do the same stupid argument forever, I got a way to... occupy your brains with something that isn't whatever Jerry thinks a point is."

Beth's eyes slide to the pods. "Are those safe?"

Rick's gaze flicks to a scorch on the wall and away. "Safe enough for people who won't shut up."

Summer walks around one pod, tapping the side with a nail. The material gives back a dull, expensive-sounding thud. "Is this another 'learn a lesson' thing?"

Rick's hands find a cable and tugs it into a neater curve. He doesn't answer the question. He doesn't need to; Rick never ran "lessons." Rick ran experiments and consequences and then pretended they were the same.

Morty stands near the door between garage and kitchen, like he wants the option of leaving without having to announce it. His eyes track the pods, then the console, then Rick's hands.

"What is it?" Morty asks. His voice was small in the garage air.

Rick finally looks at him. "It's... it's a trajectory matrix. We're going to ride along something real. Something that already happened. It's like— it's like a museum exhibit but it can't be ruined by children licking it."

Beth's eyes narrow slightly. "What trajectory."

Rick's thumb clicks a switch. A low vibration fills the garage, not loud, just present, like a refrigerator in another room. "Voyager 2," Rick says, and the name lands with a weird kind of weight. "Decades in... in a compressed run. Out. Space. The kind of stuff you people pretend to care about when you're not screaming about who didn't pick up a plate."

Summer: "So... like a documentary?"

"Yeah," Rick says. "Except you're in it."

Jerry finally commits to speaking. "And how does this solve our argument?"

"It doesn't solve it," Rick says. "It ends it. You're gonna shut up because you're gonna spend a little subjective time in the void, and when you come back, either you'll have perspective, or you'll be too depressed to care. Either outcome is a win for my ears."

Beth: "No. Absolutely not."

Summer: "Hard pass. I like my trauma organic."

Morty, small: "Rick, is it safe?"

Rick doesn't even turn to answer him, eyes locked on the console. "It's a simulation matrix, Morty. It's as safe as imagination."

He turns to face the others. "Strap in."

Beth: "Dad, you can't just force us."

Rick hits a button. The pods hiss open. Harnesses rise.

Rick, smiling: "I can make it annoying not to."

Summer: "Did you just... preheat the chairs?"

Rick: "Yep. They're warm now. Cozy. Little nests of compliance."

Jerry takes a step back. "I'm not doing this."

Rick's gaze snaps to him. "Jerry, you're doing this because if you don't, you're going to keep doing whatever this is for the next ten years, and I would rather experience the heat death of the universe than your voice."

Jerry swallows. He looks at Beth like she might save him. Beth looks away because she is tired and because she knows she will lose.

Summer mutters something about "this is so stupid" and drops into the first pod.

Beth hesitates the longest. She looks at Rick, searching for some hint of softness, some justification. Rick gives her nothing. She sits in the second pod.

Jerry stays standing.

Rick is typing something on the console. He pauses.

"Jerry."

Jerry clears his throat, voice smaller. "I just... I just need to use the bathroom first. I have to, uh. Go."

The garage is quiet for half a second. The kind of quiet that exists just to let someone be humiliated properly.

Rick stares at him like Jerry has asked to stop the universe so he can tie his shoe.

"You have to go," Rick repeats. Flat.

Jerry nods, hopeful. "Yeah. So if we could just—"

Rick cuts him off. "No. You're fine. You're not gonna die because your widdle bladder is scared of space. Get in the pod."

"Rick, come on, it's just—"

"It's just what, Jerry?" Rick snaps. "It's just a human function? News flash: everything you do is 'just' a human function. You're a walking compromise between meat and panic. Sit down."

"Dad, let him—"

A loud hiss cuts her. The third pod is waiting for its user.

No one is talking anymore.

Jerry is suddenly very aware that he is the only one still standing.

He glances at the kitchen door. It feels farther away than it did a moment ago.

He exhales and steps forward. He slides in the third pod, open and waiting. Harnesses slide over his shoulders and buckle with a click that sounds too final.

"You want to keep arguing about bodily autonomy, Beth?" Rick says, hand hovering above the screen. "Great. Do it in space."

He hits the final switch.

The pods seal with a soft pneumatic hiss.

And then they were in space.

There was no tunnel, no flare, no sensation of motion. One blink contained a garage; the next did not.

Jerry breathes in. The air moves through his chest as it always did. He hears it, too loud, in place of everything else. His body insists on weight; old habits hold his limbs at slight angles, correcting for a gravity that no longer applies. He moves his hands experimentally, fingers spreading, closing. They encounter only the feel of his own skin, and no resistance from anything else.

Ahead of him, Earth. Large. Large enough to make anything else feel small. Behind him, a field of stars that refused to twinkle.

He remembers when Morty shown him those ISS videos. A guitar solo in the observatory module. Here, there is no guitar solo. No space station. Only Earth. Only space. Only him.

A hum follows him. It sits under everything like a buried engine.

"Hello?"

The sound left his mouth, entered his ears. The space around him had done nothing with it.

He tries again, louder. "Rick!"

Silence follows, not as an event, but as the default state returning.

Back in the garage, Rick grabs a flask from his lab coat pocket, and takes a sip. He glances at the motionless body of Jerry in the pod, his head hidden behind the opaque compartment. The experiment has started.

In another instance of the program, Beth opened her eyes to the same starfield. Her body knew down and reached for it, found nothing. Her arms floated just away from her sides. The hum filled the gap where household noises should have been.

Earth sat ahead of her.

She looked around, slow, testing the limits. A slight turn of her shoulders tilted the whole view; the stars rotated as a rigid sheet. She stopped moving.

"Okay," she said quietly, to nobody. The word went nowhere. She watched her own breath condense in the inside of an invisible helmet that didn't exist, then realized there was nothing on her face.

She waited.

In Summer's instance, the initial seconds produced a high, involuntary noise from her throat. It wasn't quite a scream. More surprise shoved through a narrow opening.

"Great," she uttered into the hum. "Space."

She spun slowly, the first turn too fast, the second correcting. The starfield smeared, then resettled.

Ahead, Earth. Behind, the black.

She made a face at nothing, then rolled her eyes, a reflex with no audience.

After an interval that might have been seconds or minutes — there were no clocks here, only breaths — Earth began to recede. Not dramatically. Its apparent size shrank so subtly that noticing required her to fix on a cloud pattern and keep tracking it.

Summer tried anyway. It gave her something to lose.

Meanwhile, Jerry is still close enough to see the moon as a presence. Earth, still a blue-white wound in the dark. Not yet small, not yet gone.

He watches it, and for a moment his face is almost peaceful. Then he swallows.

Somewhere in him, a mundane need is waiting. It is not loud yet. It is just there, like a hand on a doorknob.

Beth and Summer are already months ahead.

Jerry escapes Earth, slowly. He keeps expecting Rick's voice to cut in, annoyed, saying he'd fixed it, that this was all very funny and temporary. The first days, he rehearsed what he would say to him. He did not rehearse dignity. He rehearsed anger. He rehearsed finally being right.

Eventually, he reaches interplanetary space. Silence stopped feeling like a pause and started feeling like a condition. He screamed once. There was nowhere for sound to go. That should have been obvious, but panic is not interested in obvious things. Panic wants witnesses.

Eventually, he realized no one was coming.

He had hated Rick with a precision that surprised him. Not the general resentment. Not the slow, domestic bitterness of being dismissed at the table. This was focused. Chemical. He replayed every time he had been laughed at, corrected, reduced to a punchline. He imagined speeches he would never give. He imagined him apologizing, which was the least realistic fantasy of all.

Now, he is a man in a shirt in the void between planets. Anger needs fuel and an audience. Jerry had run out of the former and the universe refused to give him the latter.

Sometimes, he thinks about Beth's laugh. Morty's face. Summer rolling her eyes. Even Rick, disgustingly.

Sometimes, he thinks about peeing and then thinks about anything else because thinking about peeing makes it worse.

Jupiter, enormous, banded, unreal in its patience, came into view. It filled the field of vision with a slow confidence, the kind of size that made your sense of scale feel like a lie you'd told yourself for years. The Great Red Spot hung there, not swirling, not storming in any cinematic way, just existing as weather that could swallow continents without noticing.

Beth could see the storm blotches as discrete ovals, not seasoning in a textbook photo. For a moment she simply stared, all the arguments and counters she'd been saving for Rick reduced to quiet observation.

She reached up to push a strand of hair off her face, forgetting there was no wind here.

She reached a hand out as if expecting to touch a surface. Her fingers met nothing. She let the arm drop back in, careful now not to set herself spinning.

"Nice," she said under her breath, and the word came out with the flatness of someone grading a school project.

Summer appeared and left with even less ceremony. One moment she was complaining to herself about the boredom of the starfield, the next she blinked and found the enormous striped globe in front of her, already receding.

"Come on," she muttered. "At least give me, like, a tour guide."

She started to narrate what she saw in a mocking tone — "On your left, children, you'll see nobody cares" — but her voice thinned halfway through, not from emotion, but from the effort of supplying both sides of a conversation.

### 2. This is not Therapy Concrete

Jerry met Jupiter much later.

At first it was just a brighter point among others. Then a dot with a hint of color. He watches it grow because not watching meant having nothing to do but listen to the hum and his own small movements.

His hand finds his abdomen again and stays there, fingers pressing in sets of four. There was a steady pressure that never fully receded, only shifted into background when he got distracted by the sky and came back sharper when he noticed it.

The dot becomes a marble, then something bigger. The bands resolve into stripes. The Great Red Spot edges into visibility, a bruise in motion.

While it grows, he experiments with movement. He rotates his shoulders, discovers that a slow, deliberate twist would turn his body without making him dizzy. He holds his arms out, elbows slightly bent, palms floating somewhere between reaching and bracing.

When Jupiter finally fills most of his view, he does nothing dramatic. His gaze soaks in the orange and cream bands. His mouth parts as if to say something he did not select.

He scratches his ear. The gesture looks as on the couch at home, out of place only because of what it sat in front of.

The planet drifts past. Its departure was almost imperceptible; the curve eventually shifts enough that he has to turn his head to keep it in sight. He doesn't. He lets it go.

His breathing continues, measured. The low hum keeps its pitch.

After Jupiter, Saturn came in with its rings tilted, a pale halo that seemed too delicate for something so massive. The rings weren't dramatic; they were geometry. Light and shadow and innumerable particles in obedient orbit. Summer watched the shadow of the rings crawl across the planet's surface with the slow inevitability of an afternoon.

After Saturn, the space between landmarks widened. The stars stayed. The hum stayed. Summer's throat was dry. She licked her lips and tasted nothing.

"Is that it?" she asked. And the question sounded dumb as soon as it left her.

For Beth and Summer, the mission became a fast-forward museum film, with their own commentary as the audio track.

They drifted through the highlights, bored in the way humans get bored when they are not the protagonist. Surprise becoming habit, wonder becoming boredom.

Uranus. Neptune. The long outbound coast they call the heliopause.

Meanwhile, Jerry drifts.

Long stretches without novelty compress in a way that isn't dramatic. He doesn't hallucinate. He doesn't scream. He just exists at human tempo, which is not built for deep space.

He makes rituals out of nothing.

He counts breaths until counting becomes meaningless.

He touches his own arms, feeling skin, remembering that he has edges.

He tries to sleep, but without light, without gravity, without time markers, sleep becomes a suggestion. He closes his eyes, opens them, and nothing has changed.

His need becomes a companion. It rises, then plateaus, then becomes part of the background noise of being alive. Pain, yes, but not cinematic pain. The kind of pain you carry because you have no choice. Years of needing something mundane and humiliating and unresolved, layered on top of cosmic isolation.

It is humiliating, quietly.

No one is there to see it, which makes it worse in a different way. There is no performance. No sympathy. No relief.

Just endurance.

And the matrix does not allow cleverness. There is no exploit. No menu. No "wake up." No cheat code. You cannot break out of a simulation from inside if the simulation does not include the concept of breaking out.

The farther out he goes, the less there is to look at. Stars, then different stars, then the same stars with different angles.

The narrative thins. The mind hates thinness. Jerry, of all people, has practiced living in thinness for years. He knows how to fill it with small things.

Time flattens.

The simulation keeps going.

Then, without fanfare, it ends.

The pods hiss open.

Beth sits up first, blinking like she's woken from a nap that lasted exactly as long as it needed to. She swings her legs over the edge, stands, and pats dust from her sleeve out of habit, as if the garage has rules that still apply.

"Huh," she says. "This actually wasn't so bad."

Summer hops out as well. For a moment she misjudges the distance to the floor and her foot hits concrete harder than intended. The jolt runs up her leg. Her mouth opens on reflex and then stalls halfway, searching for the word that would make the experience fit into a sentence.

"It was..." She tries again, and the second try is worse. "It was... stupid. Cool stupid. Whatever."

"Summer," Beth says, the warning mild but automatic, the old mother-tone sliding back into place like a door that closes itself.

Her eyes move, already expecting Jerry. The angry exhale. The explanation. The need for them to understand the exact shape of his suffering.

But he is still in the pod. His eyes are open. His face is calm in a way that doesn't read as okay.

"Jerry?"

On the other side of the garage, Rick doesn't look up.

He's at the terminal, shoulders hunched forward, lit by the screen's pale glow. Where the three identifiers were, there are logs now. Durations. Parameters. Tidy numbers aligned in tidy columns.

Two of them match. The third does not.

Rick's index finger slides down the data. He stops. Stares at one column without blinking. Scrolls back up as if confirmation could undo it. The lines remain.

Jerry sits up, slowly, pushing himself with his arms. Measured movements. Older in tempo, not in body, like time put weight on him without changing his shape.

Beth steps toward him. Morty follows, drawn forward before he's decided to move, both of them approaching like Jerry is on a hospital bed and they're trying not to startle him back into something worse.

He listens to the hum of the garage. Not the one he knew — different in tone and pitch — but layered now with the beeps and mechanical breaths of Rick's contraptions.

Beth turns her head, her voice sharper now, aimed past Jerry.

"Dad."

Rick doesn't answer at first. He keeps staring at the screen like it insulted him personally. "Crap."

Summer squints at him. "Did you break something? Please tell me you broke something."

Rick turns, finally, and the smugness is gone. Not replaced by guilt exactly. Something more irritated and smaller, the face of a man caught by a stupid mistake he can't argue with.

"So," he says, forcing the opening like a door that sticks. "Funny thing. You all got the accelerated cut. Voyager highlight reel. Jerry..." He trails off, glances back at the screen, scrolls even though there's nothing left to find. "...got the director's commentary."

Beth's mouth tightens. "So you mean he was in there for—"

"The whole time," Rick cuts in. He tries a smile, and it lands wrong. "In a perfectly safe simulated environment."

"Alone," Beth snaps.

"What the hell," Summer whispers, almost to herself.

Jerry's eyes don't accuse. They don't beg. They just meet the room, as if the room is something he's allowed to notice again.

"It was..." He pauses, like he's checking whether the word is worth spending. "Long."

Morty closes the last step and wraps his arms around him.

It's sudden in the quiet, a clumsy burst of warmth and weight. Morty is not smooth. Hugs are not a Smith family habit. Jerry's shoulders go rigid for a beat, like his body is surprised to be touched. Then, slowly, his arm comes up and around Morty's back, his hand closing with a careful pressure, as if he's relearning what a hug is for.

Morty's voice comes out muffled against Jerry's shirt. "Dad."

Jerry's hand stays there. He doesn't grip harder. He doesn't let go.

"It's okay, son," Jerry says. The words are gentle, practiced, something he has said a hundred times in a life that no longer exists.

"It's not," Morty says, immediate. Flat. Not angry. Just true.

Jerry doesn't contradict him.

Rick's fingers hover over the console screen, restless. "It's... a config error. A single parameter. He was supposed to be on compressed time."

"I can wipe it," he tells Jerry, and the urgency in his voice is almost funny, how quickly he wants the problem to stop being a thing you can look at. "The memories. It's a lot of storage but—"

Jerry stares at him. "No."

His word is immediate. Firm. Not loud.

A beat.

"You don't get to decide that for yourself," Jerry says.

Summer stares at him like she's never seen him before.

Jerry shifts his weight, stands. Mechanical isn't the right word. He isn't stiff. He isn't weak. He's just unhurried, like he has no reason to match their tempo.

He walks toward the door that leads into the house. His gait doesn't limp. It simply refuses to rush. He sets his hand on the knob and pauses, fingers resting there. For a second he doesn't turn it. Then he opens the door and goes inside.

Summer breaks the silence first, because she always does, because silence is a thing she tries to beat into a manageable shape.

"Now I'm definitely gonna post about this."

The quiet that follows is immediate and awkward, like a conversation stopping mid-sentence and realizing it doesn't know how to start again.

Dinner happened because dinner was one of the things that made a house keep being a house. Beth cooked with her jaw set, the knife moving too fast. Summer hovered at the counter, scrolling on her phone without really reading. Morty kept glancing toward his dad, then forcing his gaze back to the floor when he noticed himself doing it.

Meatloaf and peas. Something mundane to prove that the day was still bound by meals. Beth set a plate down in front of Jerry. He picked up his fork and held it. The metal caught the light. He turned it slightly, watching the reflection bend. Then he began to eat, cutting the meatloaf into smaller pieces than necessary. Each piece was the same size. He ate them in a steady rhythm.

Rick was still in the garage. For a while, he stared at the screen like the readout might change. The matrix sat idle, fans humming with the dutiful, slow precision of a system that had completed its task as requested. Then his hand moved to a switch and the hum flipped off.

At the table, his plate sat unattended until dinner was almost half over. He entered the dining room with a screwdriver tucked into his pocket. He stood in the doorway for a second, taking inventory. His eyes paused on Jerry longer than necessary. Then he sat.

"So," Summer said, because silence in a family was always treated like a problem to fix. "Space was... space."

Jerry lifted his eyes to Summer. He looked at her for a long moment. Not blankly. Just steadily, the way you looked at someone when you wanted to be sure you were actually seeing them and not an image you'd stored.

"Yeah," Jerry answered.

That was all.

Morty barely ate. He'd twirl his fork in his peas, or dig small holes in his meatloaf, his eyes focused on his plate and nowhere else.

Summer's fork slipped from her hand and hit the edge of her ceramic plate before bouncing onto the table. The sound was sharp, metallic. Jerry's hand paused halfway to his mouth. His jaw stayed clenched for an extra heartbeat. He did not look at her. He waited until she retrieved the fork and the table settled again.

In the middle of dessert, Rick stood, already pushing his chair back.

"Alright, I'm done pretending this is normal."

His hands lingered on the table a second longer than necessary.

He was already halfway to the doorway when he added, "No one comes in the garage."

That night, in the bedroom, Beth was laying on her side, one arm propping her head up. The lamp on her nightstand cast a small circle of light. Jerry sat on the edge of the bed, taking off his socks with practiced, unhurried motions.

"Jerry—". She let out a breath, already regretting it. "How was it?"

Jerry froze. He had been expecting the question. But any word he picked to answer it sounded wrong. He considered it anyway.

"Sparse."

He inhaled.

"At first you're scared. You think about later. You count seconds. Then some point you stop because otherwise—"

Then Jerry added something because stopping there felt wrong.

"And... I've missed you."

Beth watched him for a moment, then reached over, fingers tracing a line along his forearm. His skin was warm. The muscle under it did not flinch or lean in.

She waited, hand resting lightly, then shifted closer, bridging the space between them with her body.

Jerry turned his head toward her. His eyes found her face, held there. He lifted his hand and set it over hers, pressing it down gently against his chest.

They stayed like that, neither moving much, the contact steady and unspectacular. At some point the lamp went off, the silence of the room only broken by the low house noises.

### 3. Gene's Long Visit

Two days later, Gene came over with store-bought cookies and an expression that suggested he'd practiced concern in the mirror.

He rang the doorbell. "Hey, uh. Just checking in," he said, gentle in the way people got when they didn't know what language was allowed.

Jerry nodded once. "Hi, Gene."

In the kitchen, he poured two mugs of coffee and stopped exactly where he wanted, as if the line mattered. Gene watched him do it.

"Beth said you did, like, a space thing," Gene said. "That sounds... intense."

"It was long," Jerry said.

Gene let out a nervous laugh, relieved to have a word he could use. "Long, huh. Like Epcot-long?"

Jerry's mouth twitched. Not quite a smile. "Longer."

The cookies sat between them. Gene took one eagerly, slowing only after sensing crumbs fall to the ceramic tile at his feet.

"So what is it, though?" he asked, nodding toward the door to the garage. "Some VR rig? Like one of those fancy chairs?"

Jerry hesitated. His eyes flicked to the door and away, like it wasn't a door anymore. "It's Rick's," he said. "It's not... for guests."

"I'm not a guest," Gene said immediately, and then regretted it. "I mean, I am. I just mean, like, I live next door."

They drifted into the garage anyway, because Gene wanted to see it and Jerry didn't feel like having Gene insist in the kitchen.

The pods sat there, inert. Innocent-looking, which was always the worst kind of looking.

Gene walked a slow circle around one of them, palms hovering like he expected it to bite. "Man," he said softly. "So you were in that."

Jerry didn't answer.

Gene put a hand on the rim. His fingers slid along the smooth edge. "Feels expensive."

"Gene," Jerry said, quiet. Not warning. Not pleading. Just a name.

Gene glanced back, half-smiling, already stepping in anyway. "I'm just looking."

The kitchen door slammed.

Rick came in mid-rant, arguing with someone who wasn't there, voice filling the room before his body did. "I swear to God, Morty, if you recalibrated the dampeners using intuition again—"

He barreled forward, waving a flask for emphasis, not looking where he's going.

“—because intuition is just ignorance with confidence—”

Gene turned around to say hi.

Rick shoulder-checked him. Not hard. Not malicious. Just careless.

Gene stumbled backward.

A clunk. A hiss. The harness sensed weight and completed the circuit.

Jerry's blood goes cold in a way that has nothing to do with memory.

Rick turned. The rant fell out of him all at once. His face went flat.

"No," Then, smaller: "No, no, no."

Gene laughed, still trying to make it normal. "Whoa! Hey—haha—what is this?"

The pod sealed around him.

The screen lit. A progress ring appeared: INITIALIZING.

Rick lunged for the console, fingers already moving. "Don't touch anything," he snapped, to nobody and everybody.

"Get him out," Jerry said.

"I'm trying," Rick said, and there was no joke in it. "If I hard-dump him during initialization, his brain comes back as soup."

Jerry stood still. His hands didn't clench. His face didn't change. That steadiness made Rick look worse by comparison.

Gene lay still inside the pod, eyes closed. From the outside, he looked fine. Rick stared at him through the glass until he felt Jerry watching him.

"Now what?", Jerry asked.

"We wait," Rick sighed.

The progress ring crawled. Rick's jaw tightened. He watched it like it was a personal insult.

The light flipped to green. EMERGENCY OVERRIDE: AVAILABLE.

Rick hit it immediately.

Fans spun down. The seal released.

Gene spills onto the concrete, sucking in air like he has just remembered how. His hands claw at the floor for purchase, fingers spreading wide, as if grip alone might keep him here.

"Wait," he says, too fast. "Wait, wait—"

He looks up at Jerry, eyes wide, unmoored. "Is this— is this real? You guys are real, right?"

Jerry crouches in front of him, careful to stay in Gene's line of sight. "Yeah," he says. "You're out."

Gene stares at him for a beat longer than necessary. His chest keeps heaving. His eyes dart, checking corners, checking light, checking for the hum.

Then he laughs.

Just once. Too loud. Too sharp. The sound snaps and dies instead of trailing off.

"Oh man," Gene says, breathless. "Wow. Wow. Okay. That was—"

He stops. Whatever word he reaches for doesn't arrive.

He wraps his arms around his knees, folding in on himself.

"I really thought," he says quietly, staring at the floor, "that something would happen."

Jerry's eyes stay on him. "I know."

Rick exhales through his nose. "Alright," he says briskly. "Post-isolation disorientation. Mild panic response. Elevated cortisol. No lasting neural insult."

Jerry doesn't look away from Gene. "How long was he in?"

Rick checks the console without turning. "Two years." A beat. "Plus change."

He gestures toward the door. "Out of the garage." Not angry. Managerial. "This is not therapy concrete."

Jerry helps Gene to his feet and guides him toward the kitchen. Gene goes willingly, a little too willingly, like momentum has replaced decision.

Rick watches them go, then reaches for the door himself.

"And close the door behind you," he mutters, already turning away. "God dammit."

That night, Rick sat alone in the garage.

He programs the stop command three times. Tests it. The pod powers down instantly each time. Perfect. Flawless. The universe obeys when Rick asks nicely.

He laughs. Too loud.

"Let's see how long I last in this thing."

He enters parameters on the console. Rick Sanchez, conqueror of infinity, setting his own time limit like he's microwaving leftovers.

He climbs into the pod, straps himself in with practiced ease, and sneers at the ceiling like he's daring the universe to bore him.

The pod seals.

"Three... two—" he counts, because even Rick sometimes indulged in ritual, and then the garage drops away.

Space.

Earth hung ahead, familiar. He recognized the cloud patterns from a dozen satellite overlays he'd seen. Here, there was nothing to annotate them with.

"Okay," he says, already bored.

In his hand, a crude, ugly block with a single button covered by a plastic guard. A kill switch, made for a man who didn't trust himself to endure.

Gravity's absence made his joints feel looser. He rotated one shoulder, more to check that the movement registered as his than anything. The stars rotated too, their grid shifting fractionally.

He stared straight ahead, jaw clenched.

Jupiter approaches.

Even Rick goes quiet for a second. Not awe, exactly. More like recognition of scale as an insult.

He drifts, watching the gas giant fill his vision.

"Yeah, yeah," he mutters. "Seen it. Big gas. Very impressive."

The remote is warm in his hand. Reassuring. A promise.

He could end it. Immediately. No shame. No consequence.

He doesn't.

Jerry and Gene didn't have a button. They stayed because they had no other choice.

So he stays too.

He tells himself it's scientific curiosity. He should know what they actually felt, not just mock it from the outside.

Time stretches once more.

Saturn's rings glide past. Rick narrates them to himself, habitually. Mass, density, resonance. He is not awed. He is informed.

Uranus tilts. Neptune fades. The Sun becomes a star among many.

The commentary slows.

Somewhere between the heliopause and interstellar nothing, Rick realizes something irritating.

No one is arguing with him.

No one is impressed. No one is disappointed. There is no audience for brilliance here. The universe is doing its thing without checking his resume.

Rick frowns.

"Okay," he says. "Cute. I get it."

He raises the remote.

Doesn't press it.

Time keeps going.

Interstellar space has no monsters. No revelations. Just distance.

Rick feels the itch start. The one he usually kills with a portal or a joke or a drink. There's nowhere for it to go.

He grips the remote harder.

"This is dumb," he says. "I could leave. Any time."

He doesn't press the button because leaving feels like failing a test no one has assigned.

He owns the deal. He is in charge.

And suddenly that's the problem.

Minutes stretch. Then hours. Then the concept of hours starts to feel like something he invented to avoid silence.

Rick notices his thoughts circling. Not equations. Not plans. People.

Beth at twelve, fixing an engine just to prove she could.

Morty looking at the stars like they might answer him back.

Jerry, quiet, steady, surviving something Rick never bothered to understand. He remembers his voice in the garage, asking for something small and mundane.

He imagines him at year ten. At year twenty. Still needing to pee. Still having nowhere to put that need.

Rick laughs once, sharp and ugly.

“Wow,” he says to no one. “That's… that's diabolical.”

He grips the remote harder.

This is the part he didn't account for. Not the suffering. The banality of it. The indignity of being trapped in the infinite while your nervous system keeps filing the same stupid request.

He remembers dismissing it. Calling it irrelevant. Treating it like noise.

"Jerry... you idiot." he says to the void, but there's no bite to it; only recognition.

He presses the button, without drama.

The experiment is done.

The pod cuts out instantly. No resistance. No punishment. Rick slams back into the garage with a gasp, heart racing, hands shaking like they've just been somewhere they weren't supposed to stay.

The seal hisses open.

He climbs out and stands, swaying slightly before his balance decided which way was down. He stares at the pods as if they'd betrayed him by being accurate.

### 4. A Presidential Christmas

The next morning, Rick works.

Soldering a contact, pausing to test continuity, tightening a screw until it stops, not past that. He doesn't swear. That alone is an announcement.

The pods sat inert in the center of the floor. Rick pulls a heavy metal plate from a drawer and bolts it onto the console's side. He runs wires through a channel and covers them with a protective sleeve, the kind of sleeve you used when you don't want anyone to accidentally touch something ever again. He drills into the casing, mounts a blocky component that clicks into place with a finality that doesn't look like it could be undone with a screwdriver.

He finishes, wipes his hands, and speaks to no one.

Morty appears in the doorway, a cereal bowl in his hands. "Rick?"

Rick doesn't look up. "What."

Morty steps in, eyes on the pods. "What's this?"

"Human interlock," he mutters. "No human subjects. No override."

Morty doesn't know what to say. So he says the only honest thing. "Okay."

Rick waves him away, irritated at the existence of softness. "Get out."

Morty leaves.

Rick stands there, alone, staring at the interlock like it's an insult.

He stares at the finished work for a long time.

He sighs, almost inaudible. Ethics were considered. Decisions were made.

This should have been the end of it.

But Rick Sanchez does not stop thinking.

The matrix isn't cruel by default. The cruelty came from mismatch. From asking a human brain to carry infinity with a bladder and a memory of being dismissed.

What happens if the subject doesn't care about infinity?

A pigeon was sitting on the fence in the backyard, head cocked, watching the world with mild suspicion.

Rick opened the back door and tossed a crumb out with lazy precision. The bird hopped closer. Rick moved with sudden speed, net appearing from nowhere, scooping it up in a motion that did not give the bird time to understand the concept of being caught.

Inside the garage, Rick held the pigeon gently and firmly, hands wrapped around its body, wings tucked. Its heart beat fast against his skin. It made tiny, frantic movements that meant nothing to Rick's grip.

He set it into a pod modified with smaller straps, an absurd little harness. He tightened them just enough.

The bird's beak opened. No sound reached Rick. The hum would handle sound later.

"Don't look at me like that. Science isn't gonna stop just because humans are fragile little story machines."

Fans spun up.

The bird went still.

Rick would observe it inside the matrix through the screen, the way you observe ants through the glass of a terrarium.

The pigeon did not panic at the absence of ground. It treated the stars like wind. Direction without destination. The lack of landmarks didn't distress it. It navigated by change itself.

Rick watched the readout of the pigeon's brain activity.

"Well I'll be damned," he murmured. "You're better built for this than we are."

Birds don't conceptualize time the way humans do. Their brains are light, fast, always present. No long-term narrative. No existential accounting. Just now, now, now. A succession of moments stitched together by instinct.

A few minutes later, the matrix stopped.

Rick unstraps it quickly. He carries it to the open garage door and releases it.

The pigeon exits the pod ruffled, confused, immediately poops on Rick's boot, then flies off to sit on the roof like nothing happened.

Rick laughs. A real one. Brief.

"...yeah," he says. "Figures."

He doesn't tell the family. Not because he's hiding it. Because there's nothing to confess. No one is harmed. No one is traumatized. No one comes back quieter than they left.

What he learns unsettles him anyway.

Humans suffer in the void because they expect meaning.
Animals move through it because they expect experience.

No narrative. No scoreboard. No giving up.

Rick keeps testing. A sparrow. Mice. The results are similar. Novelty without boredom. Motion without dread. Stress spikes at first, then flattens into a low hum of alertness. Animals don't wait for rescue. They don't feel abandoned. They simply adapt.

Rick shuts the pod down for the night. Pats the casing once, like you'd pat a machine that almost taught you something useful.

Somewhere on Gene's roofline, the pigeon coos, unimpressed.

Rick locks the garage.

The matrix stays.

Humans are done.

By Christmas, the house had begun to mimic its old rhythms again. People moved through rooms. The television played. Summer complained about school. Beth drank wine. Morty did homework at the table with his head down. Christmas decorations, but in the half-hearted way people decorate when they're trying to prove they still do family things.

Jerry did dishes without being asked. He folded laundry into stacks so neat they looked like they'd been measured. He got up early and made coffee and drank it slowly, mug cradled in both hands as if heat was information.

Rick wasn't making jokes at Jerry's expense as much. He didn't make a point of it. He simply found other targets or stayed silent. When Jerry spoke, Rick sometimes waited a beat before talking over him. It wasn't respect, not in any sentimental sense. It was a recalibration of what Jerry's presence meant in a room.

On Christmas Eve, the sky was cloudy. The stars were hidden behind a soft gray ceiling. The neighborhood put up lights anyway, strings of color trying to imitate a cosmos that didn't answer.

A helicopter arrived like a loud mistake.

It shook the house with its rotors. The windows rattled. The front yard lit up with searchlights and men in black moving with the urgency of people who believed urgency could bend reality.

The President of the United States walked up to the Smiths' front door as if it belonged to him. His posture was hero-straight, chin up, teeth ready. Secret Service flanked him like punctuation.

Beth opened the door and froze.

"Not again," Summer commented from the sofa, barely glancing an eye from her phone.

Rick appeared behind Beth with a flask in his hand, wearing the expression of a man who had just been informed that his evening had been stolen.

"Rick Sanchez," the President boomed, smiling like the camera was always on him. "Merry Christmas. I've got a situation."

Rick's eyes flicked over the agents, the gear, the confidence. His mouth twisted. "You always do."

The President's grin shifted into business mode. He turned slightly so they could see the helicopter blades visible over the roofs beyond. "An object appeared above the Pacific two hours ago. A big one. It's broadcasting in English and... rhyming couplets, for some reason. Your name came up."

Rick's gaze slid past the President's shoulder, into the garage. The door was open.

The terminal sat where he'd left it. Quiet. Powered. A single red LED burned steadily on the interlock.

He felt it, stupidly, like the thing was watching him.

For a half-second, he pictured the President in the pod.

The smile. The noise stopping. Bravado dissolving into scale.

Rick's mouth twitched.

"You got your little... projects in there," the President added, casually, as if discussing a neighbor's tool shed. "Whatever helps you save the world today, bring it."

"Yeah," Rick said. "I'll make sure I do."

Behind him, Jerry stood in the hallway with the half-untangled lights draped over his arms like a soft, luminous burden. He stared at the suits, at the man on the porch, at the silhouette of the chopper beyond the street.

The President noticed him and gave a politician's nod. "Jerry. Taking the season seriously, I see."

Jerry inclined his head a fraction, neither smiling nor scowling. The lights shifted slightly as his hands adjusted their grip.

Morty appeared on the stairs, drawn by the strange combination of blades and authority. Rick turned and jerked his head toward the door. "Suit up, Morty. Sounds like they need us."

Morty hesitated, eyes flicking to Jerry for permission he didn't explicitly need. Jerry's gaze met his briefly. His fingers flexed around the cord, loosening a small knot without looking.

"Go," Jerry said, with the small pride of a father waving off his son to a field trip. Before, Jerry would have complained, objected about homework, dinner, or other normalcies. But now, his word came out steady.

Morty nodded and hurried upstairs for his jacket.

Rick stepped onto the porch, brushing past the President. Beth lingered in the doorway, watching them descend the steps, the swarm of suits closing in.

Jerry moved to the side to avoid being in anyone's way, the lights still hanging from his arms.

The helicopter took off. Jerry held his hands up, shielding his face from the wind. When the wind settled, he waved at them.

He stood there for a while, not finishing the untangling yet. The weight and texture of the cords in his hands seemed to occupy him enough.

From down the hall, the faint rush of water came again — someone running a tap, maybe, or Summer taking a shower. The sound filled the house's bones, a small, constant movement cutting through the quieter air.

Jerry listened to it without moving, lights pooled in his arms, the simple, mundane flow marking time more reliably than any distant trajectory ever had.

### Annex: Jerry's Memoir

Beth had a coupon for three free sessions with Dr. Wong, so she made me go. I had not much to tell. I told her I felt fine. She nodded. This might be outside the realm of traditional psychology. One of the things she advised me to do is to engage in "creative expression". So I'm writing this now. For no one in particular. I wouldn't call it a diary, a journal, or anything like that. I never had one of those things growing up. It never felt necessary.

I survived Voyager 2.

Here's why you should too.

---

I did not go to space in a heroic way.

There was no countdown, no applause, no sense that I had earned it. I was left running. That detail matters. I did not choose the void. The void was assigned to me by someone who forgot to check a setting.

For a long time, I was afraid. I waited for instructions. I waited to be evaluated. I waited for someone to tell me I was doing it wrong. Nothing happened. That was the first lesson. The universe does not care enough to disapprove.

Time stopped behaving. Days meant nothing. Years meant even less. I learned that the mind will invent structure if none is provided. I made routines. I broke them. I argued with myself and lost. I forgave people who were not present, which turns out to be the only kind of forgiveness that actually works.

There is a special loneliness that comes from knowing no one is watching. It is not dramatic. It is administrative. Eventually, it becomes spacious.

Somewhere along the way, I stopped needing to be impressive. There was no one to impress. I stopped needing to be right. There was no argument. I stopped needing to be loved in order to feel real. I was already there.

When I came back, everything felt too loud. Not hostile — just fragile. People speak as if their words will echo forever. They do not. What echoes is presence. Sitting at a table. Passing bread. Saying nothing and meaning it.

I love my family differently now. Less urgently. More carefully. I do not need them to justify my existence. I only need them to exist near me.

As for Rick, I understand him better. He fears stillness. I have lived in it long enough to know it is not an enemy. It simply removes excuses.

If you are looking for wisdom here, I do not have any to sell. All I learned is this:

The universe is vast enough to make you irrelevant.
Life is rare enough to make you responsible.

I am not enlightened. I am not fixed.
I am here.

That turns out to be plenty.

---

At the beginning, I panicked.

I want that on record, because later calm has a way of lying about its origins.

The first day felt like a mistake that would be corrected. I kept expecting Rick's voice to cut in, annoyed, saying he'd fixed it, that this was all very funny and temporary. I thought about what I would say. I couldn't wait to finally be right. To finally have Rick admit his wrongdoings.

The second day, the silence stopped feeling like a pause and started feeling like a condition. I tried to scream. A full-body, throat-twisting exhale aimed straight into the indifferent black. My throat felt tight for a while after that.

Anger helped at first. It gave the time edges. It gave me something to push against. I measured days by how much I still wanted to hurt him. When that number stopped changing, I got scared again.

There was a moment — I don't know how long in — when I realized no one was coming. Not because Rick was cruel, but because Rick was careless. That hurt more. Malice at least acknowledges your existence. Forgetting suggests you were never heavy enough to register.

I remember thinking: this is how it ends. Not with violence, not with meaning. Just with a man sitting inside a machine, furious at someone who has already moved on.

That was the worst part. Not the isolation. The irrelevance.

And then, slowly, even that burned out.

When the anger went, it felt like losing a limb I had relied on too much. I didn't feel better. I felt undefended. That's when the real work started, though I wouldn't have called it that. I would have called it surviving the day without inventing a reason to scream.

Looking back, I don't romanticize those first days. They were small and ugly and loud inside my head. I was not brave. I was not insightful. I was a man who had been left behind, finally forced to notice how much of his life had been spent waiting for permission to matter.

I did not forgive Rick then.

I just ran out of energy to hate him.

That, it turns out, was the beginning of everything else.

<u>Voyager 2 Experience</u>
★★★★★ (would not recommend, still five stars)

I did not book this. There was no confirmation email. I was not asked about dietary restrictions or time perception preferences. I was simply placed into it because someone forgot to toggle a dropdown. That said, I feel obligated to be fair.

<u>Ambience</u>\
Impeccable. Truly unmatched. Vast, silent, and aggressively unconcerned with my presence. If you enjoy open floor plans and minimalist design taken to a sadistic extreme, this is the place. No background music, which at first feels rude, then merciful.

<u>Service</u>\
Nonexistent. At no point did the universe check in to see how I was doing. No updates. No apologies. No complimentary peanuts. Eventually you stop expecting them and that's when the real experience begins.

<u>Attractions</u>\
Jupiter is doing way too much. Saturn is showing off but I respect the craftsmanship. Uranus feels like a prank someone committed to. Neptune is understated and therefore the best one. Interstellar space is an acquired taste — very quiet, very honest, not for everyone.

<u>Time Management</u>\
Bold choice. Past the first year, it becomes a lot for a first visit. That said, once you get past the screaming and the bargaining, the pacing improves. There is a long middle section where nothing happens and that turns out to be the point.

<u>Personal Growth</u>\
Unexpected but significant. Lost my need to be impressive somewhere between Saturn and the heliopause. Found a tolerable relationship with myself around year thirty. That alone feels worth the trip, though I would have preferred a pamphlet.

<u>Would I do it again?</u>\
No.

<u>Did I like it?</u>\
This is tricky. I did not enjoy it. I did not have fun. I would not bring friends. But I left with fewer illusions and a calmer nervous system, which is more than I can say for most experiences that promise enlightenment.

<u>Final thoughts</u>\
The Voyager tour does not care if you like it. That's its strength. It will not validate you, entertain you, or remember you. It will simply keep going.

Five stars. I hated it.
