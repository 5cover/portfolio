  , as I needed a library to provide a simple, easy-to-use wizard UX component.
</p>
<h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>
<p>
  For making wizards, I initially used the Xceed Extended WPF Toolkit™
  <sup id="cite-ref-1">
    <a class="link" href="#ref-1">
      [1]
    </a>
  </sup>
  . It worked, but I had missed an important detail: my project uses the MIT License
  <sup id="cite-ref-2">
    <a class="link" href="#ref-2">
      [2]
    </a>
  </sup>
  , while the Xceed toolkit uses a custom license
  <sup id="cite-ref-3">
    <a class="link" href="#ref-3">
      [3]
    </a>
  </sup>{' '}
  which was, after careful inspection, not compatible with the MIT license. This means I was **exposing myself to a
  lawsuit from Xceed**. While it would have been unlikely for the issue to take such dramatic proportions, I indeed was
  exposing myself to legal troubles, even maybe a cease-and-desist letter from Xceed.
</p>
<p>
  So, I decided to make my own wizard library, in accordance with the <q>build your own mountain</q> philosophy.
</p>
<h3 id="result">Result</h3>
<p>
  In the end, I did not end up using **WPFZard** in WinClean. This is because I've found that previous versions of the
  Xceed toolkit are licensed under MIT, so I can legally use them in WinClean. It was a nice project, though, and I
  taught me a lot about making reusable WPF components.
