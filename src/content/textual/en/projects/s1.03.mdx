<p>The goal of this project was to create a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP" data-definition-id="php" class="link definition-tooltip-trigger">PHP</a> document generator using Docker containerization and also using PHP, scripting <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)" data-definition-id="bash" class="link definition-tooltip-trigger">Bash</a> etc. We were in groups of 4.
