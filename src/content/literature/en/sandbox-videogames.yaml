They have one thing in common: they are survival-oriented <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft\" data-definition-id=\"minecraft\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">Minecraft</a> servers, where players are free to build whatever they want, amass wealth, and trade with other players in a simulated economy.</p>\n</div>\n<article>\n    <h3>SurvivalWorld</h3>\n    <div>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my SurvivalWorld base\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/base-sw.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>My base on SurvivalWorld</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>The legendary French-speaking survival server. It has spanned the game's versions. Opened in <time datetime=\"2016\">2016</time>, I only joined in <time datetime=\"2019\">2019</time>. Although I have been inactive since joining BUT Informatique, I have had great times with its welcoming community.</p>\n        <p>With the plethora of free time that confinement gave me in 2020, I built a business empire. I became one of the richest players on the server.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my quartz tower\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/tour-quartz.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>Evidently, I had a lot of free time. This was during the Covid-19 lockdown.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>I have built and lost friendships. I explored, built, colonized, exploited, automated, and amassed a lot of wealth throughout this fictional world.</p>\n        <p>However, over time I gradually grew tired of the game and chose to donate all my possessions to a friend.</p>\n        <p>But hey, maybe one of these days I'll come back and have a look.</p>\n    </div>\n</article>\n<article>\n    <h3>Dreamfinity</h3>\n    <div>\n        <p>Minecraft is a very complete game, but I've always had an interest in mods. Especially in relation to industrialization and automation.</p>\n        <p>Because yes, in video games what I like the most is exploiting the environment, building factories, automating production. It's better to do this in a video game than in real life.</p>\n        <p>For this you need mods like <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://mod-buildcraft.com/\" data-definition-id=\"buildcraft\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">BuildCraft</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://wiki.industrial-craft.net/index.php?title=Main_Page\" data-definition-id=\"industrialcraft-2\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">IC²</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://galacticraft.net/\" data-definition-id=\"galacticraft\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">Galacticraft</a>, <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/immersive-engineering\" data-definition-id=\"immersive-engineering\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">Immersive Engineering</a>... I had already played many solo games but I was tired of them. I wanted to try the multiplayer experience.</p>\n        <p>That's why I chose to join Dreamfinity, a survival/faction server on the same theme of automation.</p>\n        <p>I started on Spacecross. I traveled the world for a while before settling down in the steppe, between 3 hills.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my base on Spacecross\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/base-spacecross.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>Screenshot of my base on Spacecross.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <h4>My (brief) space conquest</h4>\n        <p>The conquest of the Moon was a short but intense part of my game.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of me in my rocket on my way to the Moon\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/construction-fusee.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>I built a rocket to go to the moon!</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>However, after arriving, I noticed a problem with my oxygen mask and I began to suffocate:</p>\n        <p>Fortunately, the cavalry arrived: another player came to my rescue.</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of another player coming to my rescue\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/secours.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>Thanks&nbsp;!</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>Despite the language barrier, we became friends.</p>\n        <p>Finally, I was able to plant my flag (which has <em>absolutely</em> nothing to do with current events)</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my ukrainian flag on the Moon\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/drapeau.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>My flag on the Moon</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>In the end, I'm surprised to have made it this far. Even though in the end, my base was looted and I lost everything, I had a lot of fun building it.</p>\n        <p>Also, I didn't understand anything about how the server worked or the messages. It's a Russian server and there was no English translation available.</p>\n        <h4>Technocracy and the Great Reset</h4>\n        <p>Okay. A few months after this rather frustrating experience I joined Technocracy. This sub-server is similar to Spacecross, except that it is not oriented towards space conquest but industrialization on Earth. Which is, in the end, what I wanted. And so a claim system is proposed to protect its constructions from looting.</p>\n        <p>I built my base:</p>\n        <figure class=\"figure\">\n            <img alt=\"Screenshot of my base on Technocracy\" src=\"/portfolio/img/passions/sandbox-videogames/base-technocracy.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" loading=\"lazy\">\n            <figcaption>A silo that sinks underground with a glass dome and a spire symbolizing the power and glory of my industrial empire.</figcaption>\n        </figure>\n        <p>Everything was fine, however after a few months of rest it was dismay. All my resources and constructions disappeared.</p>\n        <p>After asking the question on the Dreamfinity Discord server, I learned that the world had been <strong>reset</strong>.</p>\n        <p>Suffice to say, I won't be returning to this server anytime soon.</p>\n        <p>I guess the lesson here is that solo isn't so bad.</p>\n    </div>\n</article>",
