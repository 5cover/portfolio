  "story": "<p>I've always found that in Cities: Skylines the cities have a rather bland and homogeneous international look. Where are the taste, the emotion, the particularity, all these things that make up the charm of a city? So I tried to reproduce European towns and villages, particularly French ones. And this is what created the need for a French road, which respects real standards for road markings and signs. No one had done it yet on the Workshop, so I gave it a try. I thus discovered the basics of texturing and 3D modeling.</p>\n<p>Getting a foot in the world of 3D modeling and game design has been an enriching experience for me, even if I won't make it a passion.</p>",
