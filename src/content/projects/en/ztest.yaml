  "story": "\n<p>For a long time, I had been intrigued by <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zig_(programming_language)\" data-definition-id=\"zig\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">Zig</a>, a programming language that promised to address some of the shortcomings of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)\" data-definition-id=\"c\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">C</a> while offering fresh perspectives on low-level programming. I decided to dive in and create a project that would not only help me learn Zig but also provide a practical application of the language. Thus, <strong>ztest</strong> was born &mdash; a Zig implementation of the Unix <code>test</code> command.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-challenge\">The Challenge</h3>\n<p>One of the most daunting tasks in this project was parsing the arguments. Unlike parsing a single string, I had to handle a list of arguments passed to the program, each of which was a string. Designing a robust parser with effective error handling was a significant hurdle.</p>\n<h3 id=\"reverse-engineering-the-original\">Reverse Engineering the Original</h3>\n<p>To understand the intricacies of argument parsing, I delved into the official <code>test</code> implementation, which is written in C. The source code<sup id=\"cite-ref-1\"><a class=\"link\" href=\"#ref-1\">[1]</a></sup> provided valuable insights that the man page lacked. Reverse engineering the original implementation helped me grasp the nuances of how arguments are processed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"writing-unit-tests\">Writing Unit Tests</h3>\n<p>To ensure the reliability of my implementation, I wrote about 50 unit tests using Zig's built-in <code>test</code> syntax. These tests were based on the official test suite, which is written in Perl—a language I am not familiar with. Despite this, I managed to translate the test cases effectively, ensuring that my implementation was robust and accurate.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impressions-of-zig\">Impressions of Zig</h3>\n<p>Overall, I was thoroughly impressed by Zig. Its syntax is intuitive and consistent, making it easy to pick up. The concepts are straightforward, without being overly dogmatic or coercive (unlike <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)\" data-definition-id=\"rust\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">Rust</a>'s borrow checker or <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B\" data-definition-id=\"cpp\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">C++</a>'s rule of 5). Zig's simplicity and flexibility make it a valuable addition to my toolbox for future, more <q>real</q> projects.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-build-system\">The Build System</h3>\n<p>One of the standout features of Zig is its build system. Gone are the days of <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)\" data-definition-id=\"make\" class=\"link definition-tooltip-trigger\">Makefile headaches</a>. Zig's build system is user-friendly, making the development process smoother and more enjoyable.</p>\n<h3 id=\"lessons-learned\">Lessons Learned</h3>\n<p>This project was a fantastic learning experience. It not only deepened my understanding of Zig but also honed my skills in argument parsing, reverse engineering, and writing unit tests. The challenges I faced and the solutions I devised have equipped me with valuable knowledge that I can apply to future projects.</p>\n<p><strong>ztest</strong> is more than just a project; it's a testament to the power of curiosity and the joy of learning. I'm excited to see where my journey with Zig takes me next.</p>",
