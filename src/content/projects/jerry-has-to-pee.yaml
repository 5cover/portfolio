    en: "It’s nearly Christmas at the Smiths’ house. Snow doesn’t fall, Jerry talks too much, arguments don’t stop — which annoys Rick enough to intervene. He gives them a quiet ride through deep space, stripped of meaning, full of stars. A simulated reenactment of Voyager 2. But a parameter is forgotten. A mundane need is dismissed. Rick never admits mistakes. He builds around them. This time, though, he won't be the only one paying the price."
