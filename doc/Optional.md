# Optional features

Non-mandatory, would be nice, not described technically. Explore technical feasability, implement only if immediately beneficial, defer for later otherwise. I want to avoid the classic "i have this great idea but my architecture prevents it" situation.

## Typographical normalization

Normaliser guillemets et apostrophes en leur versions typographiquement correctes selon la langue (voir si Astro peut le faire ou une bibliothèque i18ée existe).

So I can write regular quotes etc in the page source and the site generates the proper typography for each lang.

## cohere api integration

cohere is a chatbot you feed it data it answers questions. users can ask questions about it and get summaries in way that fit their need. i can feed it a TSON export of my infonodes so users can ask it questions through the API. this is not a bad idea. this could also be done with Mistral which has a free API plan.
