# Display

Some invariants about things should be displayed on the site consistently:

This is already done in the V1 site.

- Show background images as the background of cards and pages with a reduced opacity
- anchors (elements that navigate the page when clicked) grow when hovered and gain a background in the accent color (the accent color signals interactivity), unless prefers-reduced-motion is set or the anchor is a basic hypertext link (already underlined on hover, and its text color is the accent color)
- abbrevations are in abbr elements
- target blank anchors (open in a newtabs) are reserved to hypertext links (no styled link button) that underline when hovered, and an arrow glyph is displayed

## Theming

themes that define the colors and styles of the site. themes i already have formalized:

- light
- dark

themes i want in the future

- chalkboard
- windows classic
- engie fluid? since i worked with it a lot, might as well
