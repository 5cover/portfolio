# General styling guidelines

> What do you want the website to look like ?

I want to put a primary focus on

- comfort
- readability

So no fancy colors schemes or anything complicated. Keep it simple.

> Dark theme ?

YES! but an option. don't force it.

> Precise style?

For project page:

Dark background
White title, left-aligned
Abstract in italics

## Opt-in styling classes

Sometimes you don't want the basic style for an element. So, we have to opt-in our styles explicitly everywhere that we do. Or we could create classes like `not-link`, `not-figure`... but that's weird. Or is it? Not styling is the special case after all. I have to think about this more.

element|class
figure|figure
a|link
