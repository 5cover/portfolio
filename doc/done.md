# Done

## New Project field: background image

Represents the environment of a project. Background with low opacity of project cards.

## New Project field: end date

Optional. If missing then project underway.

For done projects : we will show "Termin√© - {START_DATE}/{END_DATE}"

For underway projects : "En cours - depuis {START_DATE}"

## Figma: components

Create components for

- Header
- Footer
- Project card
- Hovered project

## Contacts

LinkedIn, HelloWork...

Remove phone number (since i don't answer phone calls anyway)

## Underline current page in navbar

Would be nice

except home page since it is already bigger.

when nothing is underlined:

- we're on the home page
- we're on an page that is not on the navbar (the only one as of now are individual project pages)

## choose theme based on user preferences

with a media quary

## Definition test page

just a page with all the definitions to make sure they look right.

keep it in prod, nice easter egg.

## switch button

redo it. the current one is slightly innacurrate plus it doesnt support tab navigation
