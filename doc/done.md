# Done

## New Project field: background image

Represents the environment of a project. Background with low opacity of project cards.

## New Project field: end date

Optional. If missing then project underway.

For done projects : we will show "Termin√© - {START_DATE}/{END_DATE}"

For underway projects : "En cours - depuis {START_DATE}"

## Figma: components

Create components for

- Header
- Footer
- Project card
- Hovered project

## Contacts

LinkedIn, HelloWork...

Remove phone number (since i don't answer phone calls anyway)

## Underline current page in navbar

Would be nice

except home page since it is already bigger.

when nothing is underlined:

- we're on the home page
- we're on an page that is not on the navbar (the only one as of now are individual project pages)

## choose theme based on user preferences

with a media quary

## Definition test page

just a page with all the definitions to make sure they look right.

keep it in prod, nice easter egg.

## switch button

redo it. the current one is slightly innacurrate plus it doesnt support tab navigation

## Piano tiles wave on page load

CTA for hover.

Don't show text, just scale(1.05).

Creates some liveliness.

Left to right.

## JSON schemas

To avoid stupid errors. They look easy enough.

- Tags not present and empty tags array are considered equivalent

## Color scheme

Something mostly neutral but with some hue to give some expressivity.

## Smooth scrolling
