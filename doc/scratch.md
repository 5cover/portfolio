# Scratch area

## Référencer les compétences du BUT

Maybe project in context or tags?

## Special style for underway projects

Something that indicates movement? Maybe a moving background of arrows?

There would still be a textual indication that the project is underway to keep it explicit.

But it would look nice, and allow to identify ongoing project at a glance.

## JSON schemas

To avoid stupid errors. They look easy enough.

- Tags not present and empty tags array are considered equivalent

## Color scheme

Something mostly neutral but with some hue to give some expressivity.

## Underline current page in navbar

Would be nice

## Figma: components

1. Components tutorial
