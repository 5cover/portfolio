## Use YAML instead of JSON sytax in yaml file

we can probably automate it.

Use proper dates for start and end instead of strings

## Fallback to english strings when fr not specified but with a lang=en div

avoid duplicating

preserve accessibility

## Formalize context

avoid repetition of translations

## Remove content from `<Def>` components

There is no need to put the title inside the Def tags every time since the definition knows the title so Def can become a contentless component like img.

## ~~Read and implement prof requirements~~

Les requirements se centrent autour du BUT informatique

## Clickable history items

Stage & alternance

We make history items clickable, they lead to a long-form textual body (detail render)

Then we can go in depth about the internship and the apprenticeship

## ~~Fix Markdown definition logo size~~

## ~~Fix footer icon theming~~

## ~~Idiomatic localization?~~

## ~~Standardized MDX content~~. Currently markup is everwyhere. Image components
