## A blog about the Scratch & Done method

solo working, complements kanban words, serializes technical thought.

represent's each person "stack trace of though". not only tasks, but maybe ideas and things to explore once the stuff below is taken care of.

## Formalize the desired tone for AI blog-writing

(recover it from the web chat (section stuff))

## Formalize context

enforce correctness, specify our data model, avoid repetition of translations

## Remove content from `<Def>` components

There is no need to put the title inside the Def tags every time since the definition knows the title so Def can become a contentless component like img.
