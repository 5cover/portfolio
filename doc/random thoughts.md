# Random thoughts

1. On hover, invert the colors
2. Since Figma cannot do everything that CSS can, i need to allow myself some freedom. The Figma model won't be an exact replica of the final site. This is fine as long as the diverging parts are documented.
3. Consider letting the margin of a block be 1 character large (or 1.5? or $\phi$?)
4. Is it ok to use px or should it use em instead, Em is better right? It allows use to base our sizes on the text size, to maintain a consistent layout. I will use px in the design since they are self-contained but convert them in the implementation
5. Make interactive elements orange when hovered
6. my site will be quite hover-heavy
