    <p>The goal of this project was to optimize a Sudoku puzzle solving algorithm so that it could solve puzzles of different difficulties as quickly as possible.</p>
    <p>This project, carried out in pairs, was a particularly enriching adventure. Indeed, after the submission, our teacher organized an optimization contest. Each participant submitted their program and our teacher made several benchmarks on Sudoku puzzles 3 &times; 3, 4 &times; 4, 5 &times; 5&hellip; to determine the team with the most optimized program.</p>
    <p>My teammate Mattéo Kervadec and I won the contest hands down.</p>
    <p>Sure, we spent a few late nights, but it allowed us to learn all sorts of optimization tips and become better programmers in general.</p>
    <p>Furthermore, this project continued to grow thanks to Mattéo and I's personal investment. We improved it in our free time, eventually ending up with Sudone.</p>
