    <p>Trégoria is a fictional group of municipalities located in the North-East of Côtes d'Armor. It is made in <?= $f->def('cities-skylines') ?>, a city-building video game that allows for a limitless level of detail and customization. Trégoria was born above all from a deep affection for my place of life and a particular attention to the invisible details of our environment. You know, all those things we see without seeing, the streetlights, the power lines, the bales of hay in the fields...</p>
    <p>What's the point? Of course, Trégoria may not be <q>art</q>, at least not in the same way as a film, a monument or even a sculpture. However, Trégoria has a message to convey. Which one? Well, let's start with one of the villages in the group. Coatlédan, let's say. Then, let's zoom out. What do we see? Fields, a few houses, more fields... Ah! Trees.</p>
    <p>You only have to look up to see what Man is doing to Mother Nature's land. It's a real domination that is taking place before us. Where will this lead us?</p>
    <p>Trégoria is far from being finished, but it is far from being alone. The game community creates a huge number of worlds that carry a message, a reflection or a personal interpretation of reality. We could think for example of MARS<?= $f->ref() ?> by <?= $f->blank('Citywokcitywall', 'https://www.youtube.com/@Citywokcitywall') ?>, on inequality and the excesses of capitalism. Or Bordertown<?= $f->ref() ?>, by <?= $f->blank('Two Dollars Twenty', 'https://www.youtube.com/@twodollarstwenty') ?>, on the geopolitical stakes posed by a city built on the Mexican-American border and the repercussions on architecture, urban planning and social dynamics.</p>
